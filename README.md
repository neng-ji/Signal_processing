# Signal Processing

This project focuses on implementing various signal processing techniques. It provides tools and examples for analyzing and processing signals directly in Jupyter Notebooks. Features include Fourier transformations, signal generation, and visualization tools for plotting and analyzing signals. The `mp_notebook.ipynb` file demonstrates practical applications of these techniques using sample data to showcase how to work with and analyze signals effectively.

To run this project, no downloads or installations are required beyond having a Jupyter Notebook environment available. Simply clone the repository from GitHub using the following command:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/neng-ji/Signal_processing.git
